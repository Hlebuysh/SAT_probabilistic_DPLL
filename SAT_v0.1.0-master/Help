There are 3 pDPLL parameters:
-input <file>              selecting a file to enter the KNF
-heuristic <variant>       choosing a heuristic option for pDPLL
-output <file>             selecting a file to enter the result
-expression                allows you to enter an expression in the console

Input format:
Variables are named according to the rule x<n>,
where n is the unique number of the variable.
A variable written with a capital letter is an inversion.
Disjunctions are separated by a space,
the variables of the disjunction itself are written together.
For example:
(x1 | x2) & (not x2) & ((not x1) | x2 | (not x3))
is written as:
x1x2 X2 X1x2X3

Output format:
If cnf is solvable, the program will output a list of variables with their corresponding values.
Any means that with the other values set, the value of this variable is not important.
In the console, the program displays the time it took for the algorithm to work.
